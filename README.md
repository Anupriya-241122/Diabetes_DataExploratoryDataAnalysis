# Diabetes_DataExploratoryDataAnalysis
I'm thrilled to announce that this is my first PYTHON PROJECT.
This repository contains data analysis of diabetes patients.
EDA: Diagnosing Diabetes
In this project, As a Data Analyst I have to explore data that looks at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients.
I have conducted EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.
Note: This dataset is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases avaliable on Kaggle. It contains the following columns:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
BMI: Body mass index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

I have performed explpratory data analysis on this data on jupyter notebook using python.
Firstly imported the libraries pandas and numpy.
For futher more details of project I would request to open EDA.Diabetes_Data.ipynb file ,also it inclueds question and solution
in each steps with explaination which will help you to easily understand the use of function.I have more focused towards evaluating missing data 
and statistical view of data set.
